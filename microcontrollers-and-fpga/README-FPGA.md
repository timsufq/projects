# Two-Dimensional_Convolution_Calculation_on_Nios_II

This is a project built on Nios II platform. It computes two-dimensional convolutions.

## Overview

This project contains two parts: a Nios II image on Quartus, and a C++ program on Nios II IDE.

1. Nios II Image: The file `test_qsys.v` guides how to construct the Nios II hardware platform.

2. C++ Program: The file `main.cpp` is a program computing the two-dimensional convolution.

## FPGA

The codes in this project have been tested on the listed FPGA. Changes (pin maps, functions, etc.) may be needed for implementation on other FPGA.

1. MAX10M08SAE144C8G (MAX 10 FPGA Evaluation Board)

2. MAX10M50DAF484C6GES (MAX 10 FPGA Development Board Rev C)
